### 👀 What Catches My Eye
I've got a thing for all things **hardware wizardry**, tinkering with **Embedded Systems**, IoT gadgets that talk to toasters, and **AI & ML** that make your coffee just right.

### 🌱 Currently Sprouting
Right now, I'm diving headfirst into the mysterious world of **PLCs** and their secret languages. Shh, don't tell anyone, but I suspect they speak in binary puns.

### 💞️ Seeking a Digital Sorcerer
I'm on the hunt for a **web-app whiz** who can sprinkle some magic code dust and make our digital dreams come true! Bonus points if you can make the website tell jokes.
